# CellLevel_QC

This repository contains java code for a simple command to get cell level mapping information (% reads intronic, intergenic, multimapped, etc) from the output in CellRanger (tested with CellRanger v6, should work with more recent versions as well though no gurantees).

## How to use

To get the cell level QC information use Jar/SingleCellQC.jar. The script requires java (was compiled with version 1.8). Details to be added.
